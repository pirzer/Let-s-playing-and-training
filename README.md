This academic project shows a **Training Consulting's website** that offers Training to companies about **Ethics And Code Of Conduct, Bullying & Harassment, Sexual Harassment, Diversity & Inclusion, Social Media Policy, and Information Security**. The colours, images, and Google Map have been chosen to create a company's image as a business that is committed and working to avoid and/or mitigate work enviroment issues between CEOs, Plant Managers, HR Departments, and Employees. The structure of this project consists of 3 websites as follows:
1. Website: Company presentation, services, customer's feedback, and link to quiz.
2. Website: Quiz Form for users.
3. Website: Quiz online: questions, multiple choices, and results.

Finally, the website's design is aimed to be user friendly and responsive to different devices such as PC deskstop, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones to make a user friendly experience for website visitors.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - ### As a user or potential client/partnership/investor, I expect to navigate and find the following info: 

    -  What does the company consist of? i.e., direct to the point, a brief description of the company service and/or product.

    -  Get familiar with the company's team, and some descriptions of the their projects, customer feedback, and if there is a quiz online it would probably show part of the company resources and tools for customers.

    -  User Friendly way to contact the company and location details in the event of requesting further details for future projects.

-   ### Design
    - #### Colour Code

        -  Due to the company's association to Training Industry, the website's colours are blue, white, transparent, grey, purple, pink, yellow, green, black, transparent, red, and their variance, i.e., 5 types of blues, 2 different whites, 2 greys, 2 yellows, 2 purple, 2 pink, 2 green, transparent, 1 red and black, to sum a total 20 colours.  
        
    - #### Typography

        -  3 types of font-family were used as part of the learning and experiment process of using typography properties in coding.  

    -   #### Imagery
        -   The format of the images is jpg and gif. 

    -   #### User's Profile
        -   As a user looking for solutions for work environments, I expect to view some customer feedback, type of quiz and Subject Matter Experts as is shown already.
